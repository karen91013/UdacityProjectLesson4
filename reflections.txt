 	I've learned more of the tree structure of elements and have developed a better understanding about how to code on my own without help. In the past, I've taken courses on beginner HTML + CSS but never quite had the chance to do hands-on projects as quickly as I have during this course in the short amount of time I've spent on it.

  Understanding the concepts as I've had previous training on front-end development.

  Some of the instructions on quizzes have been semi-vague and have taken me a litlte bit of time to understand.

  Using the resources provided by Udacity's course, such as MDN element reference has really helped me when I forget or don't know how to incorporate a certain tag/element.
